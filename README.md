This Project Based on Treehouse Course Build a Weather App

The documentation of this project is located in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iSYHBnu4SRSfUDobbdKVxh6cx1Rt2gL8h3__vXmggMU/edit?usp=sharing)

The project is designed to learn about creating a network to connect with external API in accordance to RESTful API.
The external API is a weather information service Dark Sky and we will use it to build weather app. 

In this early stage we will focus on gathering information about weather in a fixed location (coordinate longitude and latitude)
to contain the learning outside building geotagging function. This will focus our learning on building necessary system to 
connect to a RESTful API.

Note : This app also have some drawables to use but not uploaded in GitHub. You can download and drag to res files in Andorid project in this [link](https://treehouse-code-samples.s3.amazonaws.com/Android_Build_A_Weather_App_v2.zip)
Update: I decided to upload the drawables bin into the GitHub just to make it practical since I plan to change 
workstation.

Update: We updated the Android Support to the latest implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'
we assume this is the latest version of android support API 28. So far we found no errors in the design page unlike the 
previous 28.0.0 which must be altered to 28.0.alpha. 

Update: We trace back to implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0-alpha1' since the latest sync on gradle
proves the problem on rendering the xml design activity page is still persist.

For the second course [Android Lists and Adapters](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/android-lists-and-adapters-2)
we use different [Google Doc as Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkhAP9DvB8Vbmr0gvy73wThuiA7pPikp7x0Z_aazET0/edit?usp=sharing)
